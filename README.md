## Overview of the Analysis

A potential investor in a combination surf and ice cream shop located in Hawaii has concerns about the effect of weather on the business. In order to reassure themselves as to the security of the investment, they have provided weather data for Oauhu, the proposed site of the shop, for analysis. The data spans seven years, from January 2010 through August 2017, and measures the daily temperatures and precipitaion as measured by local weather stations.

For our analysis, the investor has requested a statistical summary of the temperatures for June and December as recorded in the data set they provided.

## Results

The weather data for June and December is fairly consistent; however, there are three key differences as demonstrated by the statistical analysis tables.

1. As the count lines indicate, the June analysis includes more readings than December. This is due to the provided data set ending in August of 2017, resulting in June having seven years of data to analyze and December having six years.
2. Temperatures in December are more erratic based on its slightly larger standard deviation. The June standard deviation is 3.26 while the December number is 3.75.
3. The disparity between minimum and maximum temperature is more significant in December than June, 27 degrees and 21 degrees respectively.

## Summary

Based on the analysis of the temperature data, there is no indication the surf shop whould not preform well in both the winter and summer months. The temperatures hold steadly in the 70-80 degree range in the analyzed months.

However, a further analysis which takes into account precipitation and water temperatures would be recommended. It does not appear that many days would be too cold for ice cream but it is important to identify the seasons with the highest rainfall and coldest water temperatures.

While the ice cream side of the business is unlikely to suffer significantly due to the results of this air temperature analysis, the surf side will be heavily dependent on rain conditions and water temperatures.
